        ### Detailed Explanation of Comparison Metrics
        
        **Recovery Mechanism**:
        - **Classical ECC**: Classical error-correcting codes (ECC) require explicit measurement of error syndromes followed by correction based on the syndrome.
        - **Q-SHE**: Self-healing occurs automatically through Hamiltonian evolution without requiring any measurement or feedback.
        
        **Overhead**:
        - **Classical ECC**: The overhead (extra bits needed) scales linearly with system size O(n).
        - **Q-SHE**: Overhead scales logarithmically with system size O(log n), making it more efficient for large systems.
        
        **Security Scaling**:
        - **Classical ECC**: An attacker needs to corrupt approximately O(âˆšn) bits to compromise security.
        - **Q-SHE**: An attacker must corrupt O(nÂ¹/áµˆ) qubits, where d is the fractal dimension (typically 2-3), providing stronger security scaling.
        
        **Error Detection**:
        - **Classical ECC**: Errors must be explicitly detected through syndrome measurements.
        - **Q-SHE**: Error detection is implicit in the energy landscape of the recovery Hamiltonian.
        
        **Error Correction**:
        - **Classical ECC**: Once detected, errors must be actively corrected by applying specific operations.
        - **Q-SHE**: Errors are automatically corrected through passive evolution under the recovery Hamiltonian.
        
        **Implementation Requirements**:
        - **Classical ECC**: Can be implemented on conventional computing hardware.
        - **Q-SHE**: Requires quantum hardware capable of maintaining quantum states and implementing the recovery Hamiltonian.

            The graph above shows the theoretical computational overhead scaling for both approaches:
            
            - **Q-SHE**: Scales as O(log n) with key size
            - **Classical ECC**: Scales as O(n) with key size

            1. **Reduced energy consumption** for large-scale encryption systems

            ### Information Theory Analysis
            
            From an information theory perspective, Q-SHE offers several advantages:
            
            **1. Mutual Information**
            
            The mutual information between plaintext P and observed ciphertext C' is exponentially lower in Q-SHE compared to classical systems:
            
            - **Classical ECC**: I(P;C') â‰ˆ O(observation size)
            - **Q-SHE**: I(P;C') â‰ˆ O(e^(-observation size))
            
            **2. Entropic Security**
            
            Q-SHE demonstrates stronger entropic security guarantees, meaning an attacker learns very little useful information from partial observations.
            
            **3. Quantum Uncertainty**
            
            The inherent uncertainty principles in quantum mechanics provide additional protection against information leakage in Q-SHE.
            
            **4. Non-Clonability**
            
            Unlike classical bits, quantum states cannot be perfectly copied (no-cloning theorem), which prevents certain types of attacks that work on classical systems.

            **Classical Post-Quantum Cryptography:**
            
            Classical cryptography is currently transitioning to "post-quantum" algorithms designed to resist quantum attacks. However, these approaches:
            
            - Are still based on classical computational assumptions
            - May have hidden vulnerabilities to undiscovered quantum algorithms
            - Offer no inherent quantum advantages
            
            **Quantum-Native Security (Q-SHE):**
            
            As a quantum-native approach, Q-SHE:
            
            - Is designed within the quantum framework from the ground up
            - Leverages quantum mechanics for security rather than trying to defend against it
            - Benefits from the same quantum effects that threaten classical systems
            - Likely to remain secure even as quantum computing advances
            
            **Long-term Prediction:**
            
            In the long term, quantum-native security approaches like Q-SHE are likely to become the standard for high-security applications, especially as quantum computing hardware becomes more accessible.

        **Quantum Memory Coherence**:  
        Maintaining quantum states long enough for the self-healing process to complete requires significant improvements in coherence times.
        
        **Error Rates**:  
        While Q-SHE is designed to handle errors, the underlying quantum hardware still needs to have sufficiently low error rates for initialization and operations.
        
        **Scaling to Practical Sizes**:  
        Scaling up from proof-of-concept demonstrations to practically useful system sizes requires overcoming significant engineering challenges.
        
        **Integration with Classical Systems**:  
        Interfacing quantum encryption systems with existing classical infrastructure presents both technical and compatibility challenges.
        
        **Cost Reduction**:  
        Current quantum systems are extremely expensive and require specialized operating conditions.
