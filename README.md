# QuantumTheoryAnalyzer
Quantum Self-Healing Encryption (Q-SHE) represents a revolutionary approach to data security, leveraging quantum mechanical principles to create encryption that can autonomously recover from errors or attacks.


This simulator allows you to:

Explore the theoretical foundations of Q-SHE
Visualize quantum fractal key encoding
Observe self-healing ciphertext dynamics
Simulate error introduction and autonomous recovery
Compare Q-SHE with classical encryption methods

requirements:

1.` pip install streamlit matplotlib numpy qutip scipy sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary`

2. `streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000`
